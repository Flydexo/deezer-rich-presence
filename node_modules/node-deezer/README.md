node-deezer
===========

Unofficial Node.js wrapper for the Deezer API

## Installation
First, install the npm module:
`npm install node-deezer`

## Hello Deezer

Here's a quick example to get you started:

> For more, clone this repo and try out the [Express example](https://github.com/mikermcneil/node-deezer/tree/master/examples/with_express).

```javascript
// Instantiate library (can be global or instantiated in separate places-- either way is fine)
var DZ = require('node-deezer');
var deezer = new DZ();

// Now use node-deezer to generate the the link where you can redirect
// your users to allow your app to access her/his Deezer account
var appId = '28325'; // from developers.deezer.com
var redirectUrl = 'http://localhost:3000/deezerCallback'; // somewhere in your app, see below
var loginUrl = deezer.getLoginUrl(appId, redirectUrl);

// ...
// ...
// ...
// When the user has approved your app, they're sent to the redirectUrl above
// which you might handle like so:

// `code` should have been handed back by Deezer as a parameter
// if it was not, an error occurred, and we must handle it here
var code = req.param('code');

if (!code) {
  // Handle an error if one happened (see express example for more on this)
  // we'll gloss over it here
  var err = req.param('error_reason');

  // Since we have this code, we can trust that the user 
  // actually meant to grant us access to their account.
	
  // Now we need to combine this code with our app credentials 
  // to prove to Deezer that we're a valid app-- if everything works,
  // we'll get an `access_token` we can use to represent the user
  // for a period of time (or "forever" if we have the offline_access permission)
  deezer.createSession(appId, appSecret, code, function (err, result) {
		
    // If an error occurs, we should handle it
    // (again, see express example for more)
  
    // Otherwise, everything is cool and we have the access token and lifespan (`expires`)
    // in `result.accessToken` and `result.expires`
    console.log(result);
    
    // Now we can do API requests!
    
    // e.g. search for artists with names containing the phrase 'empire'
    deezer.request(result.accessToken,
    {
      resource: 'search/artist',
      method: 'get',
      fields: { q: 'empire' }
    },
    function done (err, results) {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log(results);
    });
    
  });
}

```



## Methods

#### getLoginUrl

```javascript
	/**
	 * Get the authentication url where your user should be redirected
	 *
	 * @param {String} appId			(your Deezer application id from the Deezer developer portal)
	 * @param {String} redirectUrl		(URL which will handle the user's code from Deezer)
	 * @param {Array|undefined} perms	(requested permissions [optional])
	 *
	 * NOTE: `redirectUrl` must be within the 'Application domain' specified for this app 
	 * in your Deezer developer portal at: http://developers.deezer.com/myapps
	 */
	deezer.getLoginUrl(appId, redirectUrl, [permissions]);
```


#### createSession

```javascript
	/**
	 * Generate an access token to access a user's Deezer account
	 *
	 * > NOTE: You must first have a valid `code` from the user proving that they're OK with this!!
	 * > You can get a code by redirecting the user to the url generated by calling `DZ.getLoginUrl(appId, callbackUrl)`
	 * > You'll probably want to call `DZ.createSession()` from the handler for the `callbackUrl` you specified
	 * > in `getLoginUrl(appId, callbackUrl)`, since that's where you'll have access to the `code`
	 *
	 * @param {String} appId		(your Deezer application id from the Deezer developer portal)
	 * @param {String} code			(the OAuth `code` generated by Deezer and sent to the `callbackUrl`)
	 * @param {String} secret		(your Deezer app's secret from the developer portal)
	 * @param {Function} cb
	 *		@param {Error|null} err
	 */
	deezer.createSession(appId, appSecret, code, cb);
```

#### request

```javascript
	/**
	 * Send an arbitrary API request to Deezer
	 *
	 * @param {String} accessToken			(the OAuth token representing a user's session)
	 * @param {Object} options
	 *		resource {String}				(the string name of resource, e.g. 'album')
	 *		method {HTTPMethod|undefined}	(the REST method [defaults to 'get'])
	 * @param {Function} cb
	 *		@param {Error|null} err
	 */
	deezer.request(accessToken, options, cb);
```

## To run the Express example

(1) Create your app on developers.deezer.com
  + Set application domain to `localhost` for now, and make sure and copy down your `Application ID` and `Secret Key`

(2) Copy `deezerCredentials.ex.js` to `deezerCredentials.js`

(3) Then change the app secret and app id in `deezerCredentials.js` to your app's credentials from developers.deezer.com

(4) `npm install`

(5) `node app.js`




## To run tests
`npm test`

## How To Build a Deezer App

+ Create your app on developers.deezer.com
	+ Set application domain to `localhost` for now
	+ Grab the `Application ID` and `Secret Key`

+ 2) Build your Deezer login flow
	+ You must pop up an OAuth window (or redirect, or use an iframe) to acquire an access token for the user whose account your app will access
	+ The `callback url` you specify on developers.deezer.com will be accessed from Deezer's end when the login is complete.

```
// OAuth endpoint:
https://connect.deezer.com/oauth/auth.php?app_id=YOUR_APP_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&perms=basic_access,email
```
